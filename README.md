The table presents anonymized participant identifiers, associated building zones, and the number of observations of temperature differences (T_rad − T_room) within defined temperature intervals. Temperature was recorded at 15-minute intervals, allowing conversion of observation counts into corresponding hours at each temperature difference. These data were used to compute the continuum temperature difference and cumulative temperature difference (CTD) for each participant, and to estimate the total hours of radiator operation per participant.
